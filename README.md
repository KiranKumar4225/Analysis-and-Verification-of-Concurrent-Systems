# Analysis-and-Verification-of-Concurrent-Systems


## Introduction and Context
This module will introduce you to the basic theory and principles of concurrent programming, their use in designing computer programs, with a special focus 
on formal description, analysis, and correctness of concurrent systems. In particular, you will study the safety and liveness properties of concurrent 
algorithms and protocols or policies, proving properties using model checking techniques. 
You will be using a model checking tool NuSMV to encode, analyse and verify 
various concurrent example systems.

## Learning Outcomes
On successful completion of this module you will be able to:
• Demonstrate in-depth understanding of the concepts, problems, and 
techniques of concurrent programming
• Evaluate approaches and techniques to develop safe and secure 
concurrent systems
• Distinguish, contrast, and apply the concept of traditional testing and 
formal verification
• Demonstrate the application of formalisms to specify system properties 
using temporal logics like Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) and 
Computation Tree Logic (CTL)
• Use tools and analysis techniques to study and reason about critical 
properties of the concurrent systems, including security protocols
